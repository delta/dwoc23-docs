# Goals of DWoC

DWoc aims to instill the practice of open-source culture in developers and seeks to provide an apt platform for it. 
Apart from fostering this, DWoC helps give developers exposure to industry standards and practices and devs can hone their skills. Also interacting with mentors they are exposed to the real corporate workflows.

Mentors should aim to guide and support their mentees, helping them develop technical skills and achieve project success. Mentors should also foster a collaborative and inclusive environment while instilling best practices and ethics in the realm of open source.
