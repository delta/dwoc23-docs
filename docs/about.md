# What is DWoC?

**Delta Winter of Code**(DWoC) is an open source initiative by [**Delta Force**](https://delta.nitt.edu), the official coding club of NIT Trichy, which serves as a platform for any developer, newbie or expert to make open source contributions.

DWoC is structured slightly different from popular open source projects. Organisations have projects with Issues of various levels. Contributors are tasked to complete 4 Issues, one of each varying difficulty.

Contributors will spend **12 weeks** of winter fixing issues and giving to the open source community. Through this contributors will gain experience and strengthen the community as a whole.

:::note
**Delta Force** doesn’t provide any stipend for being a part of DWoC. This is to further the contributor’s skills. Fret not, exciting goodies are awaiting.
