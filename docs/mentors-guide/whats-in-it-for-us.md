# What's in it for us?

Firstly, there is a benefit from the infusion of fresh talent and innovative ideas that students bring, leading to progress on important projects. The program allows organisations to identify and potentially onboard future contributors or employees, creating a valuable talent pipeline. 

The contributions made during the program often result in improved software quality and expanded functionality. Furthermore, this can be used as an opportunity to address critical project needs, accelerate development, and advance your organisationâ€™s mission. 

Overall, DWoC can provide the participating organisations with skilled contributors, project advancement, community recognition, and a strengthened commitment to open-source excellence.
