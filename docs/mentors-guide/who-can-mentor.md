# Who can mentor a project?

Mentors are eligible as long as their corresponding organisations are approved by DWoC organisers. The following rules are eligibility criteria for organisations:

### 1. Open-Source Nature
Organisations should have an active involvement in open-source software development. This means that the organisation's projects should be open-source, with source code that is publicly available and licensed under an open-source license and also has basic documentation

### 2. Technical Expertise
Organisations should have the technical expertise and resources necessary to mentor and support students or contributors throughout the program. This includes having experienced mentors who can guide participants in completing their projects.

### 3. Project Ideas
Organisations need to provide a list of well-defined project ideas or tasks that students or contributors can work on during the program. These projects should align with the organisation's goals and be suitable for the program's duration.

### 4. Communication
Organisations should be willing to actively engage with participants and provide clear communication channels for discussions and mentorship. Organisation should provide a welcoming environment for contributors from various backgrounds.
