# Parts of DWoC

## Organisation

An organisation represents a company, nonprofit, open-source project, or educational institution that offers specific coding projects to students or contributors. These organisations provide mentors, guidance, and resources to help participants successfully complete their projects, fostering collaboration and real-world software development experience. 

## Mentors

Mentors are experienced individuals from participating organisations who guide and support students or contributors throughout their coding projects. Mentors offer technical expertise, answer questions, provide feedback, and help participants navigate the organisation's codebase and community. They play a crucial role in ensuring the success of the program by helping participants learn and contribute effectively to open-source projects while gaining valuable real-world experience.

## Contributors

Contributors are individuals who actively participate in the program by proposing, working on, and completing a specific coding project offered by a participating organisation. Contributors bring their technical skills and enthusiasm to the project, collaborating with mentors and the organisation's community to develop valuable open-source contributions. Through their work, contributors gain practical experience, expand their coding abilities, and make meaningful contributions to the project they are working on.
